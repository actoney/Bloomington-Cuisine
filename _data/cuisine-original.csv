obj1,Taste of India,17-Feb-23,Indian restaurant,"316 E 4th St, Bloomington, IN 47408","Allowing many different foods and cultures to be represented in our college town exposes people to different ways of eating and celebrating food. An example is that it’s common to eat different Indian dishes by using picking up the food using naan; without having visited Taste of India, I may have not known about this custom. Additionally, I have friends who are from India, and it’s a reminder of home to have a place to go eat the foods they’ve grown up eating. Having wide varieties of cuisines allows other people to discover food of different cultures and allows more people to have easy access to foods from their own cultures. It brings me lots of joy to try new foods and share in someone’s favorite foods from their culture.",bloomingtontasteofindia.com

obj8,The Bowl,29-Mar-23,Korean,"2800 E Buick Cadillac Blvd, Bloomington, IN 47401","Food is a very cultural thing, so I think that by trying different cultural/ethnic foods is a fun way to enagage in learning about the people around me. Yes, I think the availability of different cuisines has encouraged people to try different foods and more readily learn about different cultures because they’re away from home (a place where you might not be exposed to as many cuisines). I think in general, the different cuisines have fostered a lot of new friendships as well because food is something everyone can enjoy and you can build friendship on just introducing each other to new cuisines. Food is something that’s deeply rooted in my family and my culture (vietnam). There’s a general consensus in our community that cooking food for others is the main way of showing love and generosity.",yelp.com/biz/the-bowl-bloomington-3
