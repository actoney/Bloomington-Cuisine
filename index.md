Between January and April 2023, we visited eight local restaurants in Bloomington, IN. 
At each location, we photographed the exterior and interior of the restaurant and interviewed numerous IU students patrons of these restaurants. With their permission, we photographed and included photos of our interviewees in our project to portray the students whose lives had been positively influenced by these restaurants around town.
