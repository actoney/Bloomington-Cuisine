Wax is inspired by [FAIR data principles](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/13427), and as such strives to make its collections findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.

Our metadata can be utilized further to observe what types of restaurants were visited, what our interviewees said about foodâ€™s influence on their cultural experiences at IU, and to recreate our exhibition. Our project can also be recreated and expanded on by others who also want to try and record their experiences at different restaurants in Bloomington.
