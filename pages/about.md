Description of Project:

	Even in Bloomington, Indiana, there is a large selection of cultural restaurants for college students to enjoy. For this project, we took inspiration from the diversity aspect of this course and looked at the array of diverse cuisine on our campus. Over the course of the semester, we examined the connections students have to these restaurants and how the presence of these restaurants on campus has influenced their cultural experiences at college. Looking at how people interact with these restaurants and the memories they have formed there will provide a better understanding of how having a wide offering of international cuisines can impact people on an individual and community level.

	For this digital collection, we collected images of and interviewed college students in a variety of local Bloomington restaurants. This provides a holistic view of this individual's experience. The goal of this exhibition is to have a collection of images from each establishment that tells a story of the elements that have most greatly impacted IU students. 

Significance of Project:
	
	When a person leaves for college for the first time, it can be scary being away from home and family. It is even harder leaving behind a life and culture one has been accustomed to their entire lives. However, students can feel at home by discovering a way to connect with their culture at college. In Bloomington, there is a wide variety of cultural restaurants for students to try. With this available, students can not only immerse themselves in a part of their own culture, but they have the opportunity to share their experiences with others and even try new cultural foods. In this digital exhibition, we conveyed the impact these restaurants have had on their patrons through short interviews. With these interviews, we learned about how these restaurants have impacted studentsâ€™ lives, friendships, and memories formed at IU. 
	
	This project allowed us to explore how people interact with local restaurants, specifically restaurants from various cultural backgrounds. Looking at how people interact with these establishments and the memories they have made there gave us a better understanding of how having a wide offering of international cuisines can impact people on an individual level. We wanted to veer away from the common statistical aspect of looking at the regions that people are from and connecting that with the frequency of cuisine from that country, but rather we wanted to show how having this variety of cuisine impacts people. 

Description of images for the project:

	For this project, we collected images of the individuals we interviewed in the restaurants. With permission from the individual we have interviewed, of course. Additional images of the restaurants as well as the cuisine they serve, may be included in order to give a holistic view of this individual's experience. Depending on the individual and their story, more images may be necessary to portray it in an accurate manner visually.  The goal was to have a collection of images from each establishment that tell a story of the elements that have impacted IU studentes the most.
