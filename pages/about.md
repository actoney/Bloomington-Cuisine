Description of Project:

	For this project, we took inspiration from the diversity aspect of this course and looked at the array of diverse cuisine located in Bloomington. Over the course of the semester, we examined the connections students have to these restaurants and how the presence of these restaurants on campus has influenced their cultural experiences at college. In this digital exhibition, we hope to convey the impact these restaurants have had on their patrons through conducting short interviews. With these interviews, we hope to learn about how these restaurants have impacted people in Bloomington. These memories will connect with the establishment as well as the dishes they serve. Looking at how people interact with these restaurants and the memories they have formed there will provide a better understanding of how having a wide offering of international cuisines can impact people on an individual and community level. 

Significance of Project:

	This project allowed us to explore how people interact with local restaurants, specifically restaurants from various cultural backgrounds. Looking at how people interact with these establishments and the memories they have made there gave us a better understanding of how having a wide offering of international cuisines can impact people on an individual level. We wanted to veer away from the common statistical aspect of looking at the regions that people are from and connecting that with the frequency of cuisine from that country, but rather we wanted to show how having this variety of cuisine impacts people. 

Description of images for the project:

	For this project, we collected images of the individuals we interviewed in the restaurants. With permission from the individual we have interviewed, of course. Additional images of the restaurants as well as the cuisine they serve, may be included in order to give a holistic view of this individual's experience. Depending on the individual and their story, more images may be necessary to portray it in an accurate manner visually.  The goal was to have a collection of images from each establishment that tell a story of the elements that have impacted the individual we interviewed the most.
