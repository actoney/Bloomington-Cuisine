### We used a questionaire for our interviewees with the following questions
**C-151 Introduction to Pop Culture Questionnaire**

1. What restaurant did you attend? 
2. How do you feel like food connects us as people? (a one to two sentence response is more than enough!) 
3. Do you feel that Bloomington's wider variety of cuisine than many other midwestern cities helps create a great sense of community? Do you think it has any effects more generally on the population?  
4. Do you have any general comments regarding the role food plays in your life or the way you build/interact with your community? 
5. If you would like to see the final result of this project please enter your email below!
6. If you consent to us using your image in this private project that will not be viewable to an outside audience, and only used for classroom purposes please type your name below. 
7. Thank you so much for agreeing to respond to this short questionnaire for our project!  Leave a comment if you like (optional)
