CMLT-151 Intro to Pop Culture Final Project Collaboration Memo

Group Members: Rose Nicholson and Austin Toney

**Week 4** 

January 31st

On this day, our team discussed what ideas we were considering for our proposal and how we would divide the workload of the project – we agreed it would be a good idea to all go to restaurants together, and we would all try to take photos of the restaurants visited. 

February 2nd 

On this day, our team discussed final revisions that need to be made to our proposal before submitting it. We also discussed different ways for us to incorporate student opinion/the voices of IU into our project idea. One idea was doing in person interviews at the restaurant when visiting, and another idea was creating a Google form to send to people who ate with us/students who were also at the restaurant. 

**Week 5** 

February 7th 

The main focus of our brief discussion in class today was the ideal timeline for our project. We thought it would be productive to visit two to three restaurants in February, and three to four restaurants in Bloomington. The only conflict that still remains is what days would work best for all of us to visit the restaurants. We also still need to resolve who will be joining our group when we eat at these restaurants. 

February 9th 

Once again in our discussion, we were struggling to find a day that would work for everyone to attend the restaurant visit. One possible solution to this is visiting the restaurant with only two group members there instead of all three, given our busy schedules. 
We also spent time discussing creating a Google form to send to those who come to the restaurant with us. We thought this would be an excellent way to keep a record of who said what and who visited what restaurant. This also seemed to be an effective way to record these conversations with college students and their take on the impact of food diversity in Bloomington. 

**Week 6** 

February 14th

On this day in class we did not discuss many project logistics. We brainstormed different questions we could ask interviewees and also created a Google forms sheet for future interviews to better organize students’ information and responses.  

February 16th 

On this day, it was agreed that Austin, Rose, and I would go to Taste of India to try the food and to interview different people who also enjoy the restaurant/what type of experiences they have had there. We also discussed what types of photos we were going to include in our exhibition. We agreed it would be a good idea to include a photo of the restaurant and the interviewees. 

**Week7** 

February 21st 

Rose, Austin, and I talked about how Taste of India went, what ways we can change our interview methods, and how we can interview more people for our project. Some ideas for this were going to some of the restaurants separately, inviting more people to come with us, or visiting more restaurants each week. We agreed it would be effective if we all brought people to join us at the restaurants to maximize the amount of people being interviewed.

February 23rd 

We did not discuss on this day – no class                                    

**Week 8** 

February 28th 

On this day, we discussed when we wanted to go to another restaurant from our project list, and what day/what people will be joining us. We agreed the next restaurant we were looking to visit were Siam House, but we had not finalized who would be coming. 
We also talked about different logistics of our project, such as the interview questions we have and what pictures we should take for our exhibition. We agreed it would be substantial if we had pictures of the people attending dinner with us (with their permission) and potentially pictures of the restaurant itself. 

March 2nd 

We continued to talk about different logistics of our project, such as the interview questions we have and what pictures we should take for our exhibition. 
One thing we did not succeed in last month was visiting the amount of restaurants we intended to visit in February when we planned our project. To make up for this, we need to visit a lot more restaurants during the month of March. 

**Week 9**

March 7th  
 
We agreed it would be a good idea to visit Siam House on March 8th to have another restaurant completed from our list. One struggle we were discussing was finding people available to attend with us. Our solution for this was to continue reaching out to people we knew to eventually find someone who could join/be available for an interview. 

March 9th 

On this day, we debriefed how Siam House went, discussed if anything went wrong, and how we could improve our planning methods for the next restaurants visited. Nothing at Siam House went wrong regarding the dinner/interview process. We also thought it might be effective to complete some of the interviews individually instead of as a group since our schedules are conflicting. 
We briefly discussed some new types of interview questions we could ask people at local Bloomington restaurants. We wanted to focus on the topic of how food can connect us. We also decided what restaurants we wanted to go to/who would be available over the break to go to a restaurant. Lindsey will not be in town the week of spring break, but Austin and Rose will. 

**Week 10 Spring Break**

**Week 11**

March 21st

In class, the logistics of the class metadata record and collaboration memo was discussed. This includes making the collaboration memo more detail oriented and to focus on wrapping up our projects smoothly before the metadata due date (March 30th). 
Rose also shared a Google Drive folder with our group, so we could add our pictures to the project/Metadata record 

March 23th 

All group members were present in class today. 
In class, we talked about the logistics of the Metadata Record and what type of information needs to be added to the record prior to submission. Austin shared the Metadata with Rose and Lindsey, so we could all contribute to what is included in the final submission of this portion of the project.                                  
**Week 12** 

March 28th  

All group members were present in class today. 
In class, we debriefed some of the restaurants we went to last week– the restaurants visited were Juannita’s, Z & C’s, and Yatagarasu. We discussed how the food was, what the people we interviewed had to say about the restaurant, and how we are regarding our Metadata progress. For the Metadata, all group members need to make sure that all our pictures/information from each restaurant is submitted to Austin. 
So far, 3 people from the 6 people we interviewed have responded to our Google form, so one thing we could do to continue our progress is reminding them to fill out that survey. 
Topic question ideas for our project:  How does food connect us across cultures as college students?   

March 30th

All group members were present in class today. 
Metadata record due tonight. Let me know if you need more time to collect info, otherwise add image structure in response to your topic question in this entry: 
Lindsey went to The Bowl and collected 1-2 more responses for the project. 
Austin submitted the Metadata record, but we may also double check with Yilin to see if more time is needed to collect more information 
Regarding our image structure connecting to our topic question, a recurrent theme from the interview responses was their cultural food making them feel at home while away from home, and enjoying sharing a part of their culture with other people/friends at college. We agreed it would be a good idea to incorporate this theme into our exhibition setup. 
(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1azzxhrPJJ9gOJeImvZgy29azHdXsPjQp?usp=sharing) As for image structure/organization for our exhibition, we primarily have photos of college students we interviewed eating at the restaurants. We believe this is an excellent photo format demonstrating the purpose of our topic question since it is college students enjoying food from different cultures and expressing how their cultural food has influenced their relationships with their friends at college. 
We could also take pictures of the exteriors of different restaurants or add photos of the food we ate to add more pictures to our collection as well as more photos to group in our exhibition. 

**Week 13** 

April 4th 

All group members were present in class today. 
On this day, we did not have enough time in class to discuss our project.

April 6th 

All group members were present in class today. 
We agreed we were in a good position for this project. We have a general idea of what we want our picture descriptions/exhibition grouping to look like, which helps when planning to prepare the exhibition site next week. In the descriptions, we agreed we wanted to include the types of food at the restaurant, location, and information about the food from the interviewee as well as the role of food in their culture overall. 
We were also discussing the possibility of going to another restaurant to expand our interview responses/pictures. 

**Week 14** 

April 11th 

All members were present in class 
We did not have time in class to discuss our projects, but we are all in agreement that we are moving steadily in our progress with the project. We had made adjustments to our Metadata 

April 13th 

All members were present in class
Metadata Record Comment: A few things to pay attention to: 1 label is a required field for wax, if you change the column name into restaurant_name, you'll still need a column called label 2 region_of_food should be "cuisine" and the fields should be standardized and typo-less 3 is location important to how food connects us as college students? If yes, the importance should be articulated; if no, useless info is mind-boggling. 4 for the final column, "/" is not allowed; the descriptions are all in the first person but who is the "I"? How do the descriptions relate to the image?
1) Austin made this change to the Metadata Record
2) Austin made this change to the Metadata Record 
3) I think location matters in reference to the proximity it is to the college campus/to illustrate the main areas in town with cultural restaurants (to illustrate the accessibility these restaurants are to students and how that influences students on campus to broaden their cultural food experiences), but we agreed location is not necessarily needed/can be omitted if necessary when connecting back to the the topic question
4) Austin made this adjustment to the Metadata record 
5) The “I” mentioned in the descriptions are all personal takeaways from the people who had visited the featured restaurants, so they connect to the image by putting a face to the quotes that will be featured in our exhibition. 

**Week 15**

April 18th 

All members were present in class today
As a class, we went through how to input our project data into Github. 
Lindsey had written the About portion of our project and shared the document into our project Google Drive. 
Austin had also reached step 8 of setting up the digital exhibition site

April 20th 

All group members were present in class today 
Lindsey wrote the browse page, credits page, and significance portion of our project
Austin had made a few small changes to our exhibition to help our site run more smoothly – For example, we changed the titles of our pictures so they fit the format for the digital collection 

**Week 16**

April 25th 

All group members were present in class
Yilin had said that our images do not match our metadata. This was because we had multiple images for one entry. In order to do this on Github, however, certain steps need to be followed to complete this. Because of this, we grouped our images together in folders by restaurant in our project Google Drive. 
Austin also attempted to resolve this issue on the GitHub website by adding folders of images there as well. 
Additionally, brief descriptions of the photos were included to the metadata record. We originally had just the quotes as our descriptions, but we were informed that that is not

April 27th  

Rose was not present in class today, but Austin and Lindsey were
Yilin updated our group that a final update in the metadata and Github image directory were needed before uploading our site
The following actions were taken to resolve these issues: 
Austin added Lindsey to the Github
Lindsey updated about, browse, credits, and reuse paragraphs on Github
Lindsey updated the image descriptions in the metadata 
Austin renamed and reuploaded our images to the Github.

*April 28th Site Launched!*
