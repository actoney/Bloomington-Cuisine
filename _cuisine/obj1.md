responses: '"Allowing many different foods and cultures to be represented in our college
  town exposes people to different ways of eating and celebrating food. An example
  is that it’s common to eat different Indian dishes by using picking up the food
  using naan; without having visited Taste of India, I may have not known about this
  custom. Additionally, I have friends who are from India, and it’s a reminder of
  home to have a place to go eat the foods they’ve grown up eating. Having wide varieties
  of cuisines allows other people to discover food of different cultures and allows
  more people to have easy access to foods from their own cultures. It brings me lots
  of joy to try new foods and share in someone’s favorite foods from their culture."'
