responses: '"Food is a very cultural thing, so I think that by trying different cultural/ethnic
  foods is a fun way to enagage in learning about the people around me. Yes, I think
  the availability of different cuisines has encouraged people to try different foods
  and more readily learn about different cultures because they’re away from home (a
  place where you might not be exposed to as many cuisines). I think in general, the
  different cuisines have fostered a lot of new friendships as well because food is
  something everyone can enjoy and you can build friendship on just introducing each
  other to new cuisines. Food is something that’s deeply rooted in my family and my
  culture (vietnam). There’s a general consensus in our community that cooking food
  for others is the main way of showing love and generosity."'
