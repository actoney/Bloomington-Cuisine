responses: '"Food is a part of us, it crosses and embraces the boundaries of culture,
  unites families, and in this way connects people to come together. Yea I think the
  wider cuisine is more inclusive for people of different backgrounds, and also provides
  those who maybe never have tried to been able to try different cuisines the ability
  to do so. I''m Latina so food has always been an integral part of my family."'
